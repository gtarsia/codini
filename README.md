# codini

My code generation tool.

Should I have used my editor's snippet system? Maybe...

You don't really `npm install` as I don't think it should be
published because it's too specific for my needs.

* `codini writefile|wf <inputfile> <outfile>`

Writes from template named `inputfile` to specified `outfile`.

* `codini writeout|wo <inputfile> <outfile>`

Writes from template named `inputfile` to stdout.
